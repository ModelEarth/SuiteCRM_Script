Installing SuiteCRM 8.6.1 Easily with a Script File

There isn't much user-friendly documentation available for easily installing this great CRM, so I created a tested SuiteCRM installation script that will allow you to install it on a Linux computer or a virtual Linux machine in under 10 minutes.

I will soon post a video with a timer to demonstrate this.

      NOTE: I am not affiliated with the SuiteCRM team, nor am I being supported by them.
